She should have died hereafter; There would’ve been a time for such a word. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recordedtime; And all our yesterday’s have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out Brief Candle! Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That frets his hour upon the stage And then Is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing.
